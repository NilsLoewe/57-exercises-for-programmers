# Exercises for programmers

The book [Exercises for ProgrammersBla][1] is (as the name suggests) a set of programming exercises. The book can be used to learn programming at all, sharpen your skills with an already known language or to learn a new language.

I will start working through the exercises with Elixir, since I want to learn it as my next language.
